# Python3 Basics
## Execution
A python file is what is known as a  python script.

AN interpreter is a program that will read and execute our script

A Console is a tool that sends low level commands to the OS. 

## REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)
### Python shell
Simply run  ***python3***
Can also be used as a calculator

## Syntax
### NameError
Whatever you have is not defined

### SyntaxError
The script does not recognize whatever you have writen Eg: ***End of script***

## Variables
### Variables is basically assigning a label to an Object.

Python variables are assigned using snake case and  in lower case. Uppercase can be used but not recommended. ***first_name ***

## input
### To add interactivity to a CLI
Use ***input("Your question?") ***
###### Everything you create in python is an object.

### Identifiers
These are names used to identify variables, functions, classes and modules or other objects.

* Must start with A-Z or a-z or underscore(_) 
Python doesnot allow punctuation characters eg @,$ and %

Python is case sensitive. 
That would mean that Manpower and manpower are two different variables.

Classnames start with upper case letters while the rest of the identifiers start with lower case letters.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

### Quotations in python
Python accepts single('), double(") and triple('''or""")
